					<h4>If I purchase the name change package, will you complete my name change for me?</h4>
					<p>No, we aren’t able to change your name on your behalf. What we offer is a name change package that streamlines the process for you. Instead of doing your own research and completing everything by hand, you’ll benefit from advanced document preparation software,</p></div><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">...</button>

					<h4>Where can I access free forms if I want to complete the process on my own?</h4>
					<p>Each state and federal agency provides their own blank name change application forms at no cost. You can find these by searching online, as they're readily available for download. However, while the blank forms are free, you may still owe fees at the time of filing. For example, most state DMVs charge a fee to issue a replacement driver license with your new name on it.</p></div><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">...</button>

					<h4>How much is your name change package and does the cost include filing fees?</h4>
					<p>Each name change package has a different price point. The divorce package is $34, marriage is $29 for the basic package and $49 for the full service, legal is $45 and family is $47. Filing fees vary depending on the type of name change. For example, a legal name change is more expensive than a married name change because court costs are incurred. Fees also vary by state, and sometimes even by county. The cost of our packages does not include filing fees.</p></div><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">...</button>
